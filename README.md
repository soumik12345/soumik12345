# Hello, I'm [Soumik Rakshit](https://geekyrakshit.dev/) 👋

### About Me

- 🖥️ I am working at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) as a Machine Learning Engineer.
- 📣 I am a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-soumik-rakshit) in Machine Learning (JAX/Flax).
- 🚀 I build MLOps pipelines for open-source repositories like [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [PyTorch-Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric), [Kaolin-Wisp](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin-wisp), [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [MonAI](https://monai.io/), etc.
- 👷‍♂️ I'm currently contributing actively on [keras-team/keras-core](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-core) and [soumik12345/wandb-addons](https://github.com/soumik12345/wandb-addons).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Neural Rendering, Neural Approximation, and Multi-modal ML models.
- 👬 I would love to collaborate on interesting Computer Vision and Graphics projects and implementations of Deep Learning Research Papers (if I have the bandwidth).
